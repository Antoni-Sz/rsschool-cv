# **About Me**

 I have good soft skills that I've improved in my previous works. And I'm also a good team player.       
 Not so long ago I relocated to Poland and I need a new job where I could improve myself every day.  
 I need a job with the ability to work remotely because I like to travel. Also I like when my job   
 has visual progress, so I decided to become a Front-end developer.  
 I'm studying the course "JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0" on the RS School portal, where I learn HTML5,  
 CSS3, Git, JS. I study a lot. In spare time I learn Polish, English, read and listening books in Polish  
 and watching movies in English.
